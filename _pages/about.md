Howdy! I’m Pranav, and I thrive at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and well-being. As a graduate student at NC State University, I am deepening my expertise in power electronics and wide bandgap devices. My academic focus is on pushing the boundaries of energy efficiency, ensuring that the systems I design are not only high-performing but also environmentally conscious.

Before pursuing graduate studies, I worked as an Applications Engineer at Tektronix, where I honed my skills in designing and testing power converters, conducting double pulse testing, and characterizing wide bandgap devices. I loved solving complex engineering challenges while collaborating with teams to deliver innovative solutions. My technical toolkit includes MATLAB, Simulink, and Python, and I have a hands-on understanding of what makes power systems tick.

Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I’m deeply passionate about creating a positive impact on people and the planet. As a volunteer with the Isha Foundation, I’ve had the privilege of helping conduct yoga programs and events that empower individuals to take charge of their well-being. These experiences have reinforced my belief in sustainability—not just in technology but also in how we live our lives and care for our planet.

Every project I work on expresses my commitment to building a better, more sustainable future. Whether I’m optimizing energy systems or helping someone find balance through yoga, my goal remains the same: to contribute meaningfully and create lasting change.
